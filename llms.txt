# Chess CV

> CNN-based chess piece classifier

Chess CV is a machine learning project that trains a lightweight CNN to classify chess pieces from 32Ã—32px square images.
The model uses MLX framework and achieves ~95-97% accuracy on synthetic training data.
It combines 55 board styles with 64 piece sets to generate diverse training datasets.
The project provides tools for data generation, model training, evaluation, and deployment to Hugging Face Hub.
